<p><img src="https://maxtrain.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/max_technical_training_papers_pens_classroom.jpg" style="width: 500px;height:250px; float:right;">My name is Skyler Adams, and I strongly believe that passion is the key to finding a fulfilling career. After graduating from high school in 2020, I started my college journey with a major in business, hoping to find my calling in the corporate world. However, it quickly became apparent to me that this path wasn't quite right for me, and I found myself struggling to stay motivated.</p>

<p>Determined to find my true passion, I made the difficult decision to switch my major to computer science, hoping that it would spark my interest. While I did enjoy aspects of the program, I still felt unfulfilled and unsure of what the future held for me.</p>

<p>That's when I discovered <a href="https://maxtrain.com/" target="_blank"><span class="red">MAX</span></a> technical training, and everything changed. I immediately fell in love with coding and found myself energized by the prospect of pursuing a career in software development. I bet on myself and my work ethic, and made the brave decision to quit my job to pursue full-time enrollment at <a href="https://maxtrain.com/"target="_blank"><span class="red">MAX</span></a>.</p>

<p>Through my time at <a href="https://maxtrain.com/" target="_blank"><span class="red">MAX</span></a>, I found myself amongst a community of like-minded individuals who shared my passion for coding. The curriculum was challenging, and I often found myself working tirelessly to stay on top of the coursework. However, my passion for the subject kept me motivated, and I was determined to succeed.</p>

<p>Despite the long hours and hard work, I found that my persistence paid off. I discovered my true calling as a software developer, and I am excited to start my career in the tech industry. I am grateful for the opportunities that <a href="https://maxtrain.com/"target="_blank"><span class="red">MAX</span></a> has given me, and I am confident in my skills and knowledge to succeed in this rapidly evolving field.</p>

<p>For me, settling for anything less than a career that fulfills me and allows me to make a positive impact on the world is not an option. With my unwavering passion, dedication, and work ethic, I know that I am on the right path towards a fulfilling and successful career in software development.</p>
